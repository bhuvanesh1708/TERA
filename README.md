✂️ TERA– Bridging Tailors & Customers Digitally

🔍 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced digital world, tailoring services still operate in a traditional, offline manner. Customers face issues such as:

Unclear measurement communication

Lack of transparent pricing

Long waiting times

Difficulty finding skilled tailors

Limited trust and accessibility


More than 65% of alteration issues are due to poor fit or miscommunication. There is a growing demand for a unified online platform that solves these inefficiencies.
